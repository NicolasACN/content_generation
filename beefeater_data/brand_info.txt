Beefeater, the only international premium gin still produced in the heart of London, and the world’s most awarded gin, is the embodiment of The Spirit of London. To this day, Beefeater gin is produced to James Borough’s original 1863 recipe, including the unique process of ‘steeping’ nine perfectly balanced botanicals for 24 hours.
Part of the Pernod Ricard group since 2005, Beefeater is a modern, energetic and urban gin with 200 years of distilling heritage and a refreshingly modern take on today’s tastes, with a range of naturally flavoured gins.
